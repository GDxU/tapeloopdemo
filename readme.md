# Tape Loop Demo

A web-based game to do horrible things to pixelated cassette tapes...

This project is mostly discontinued, was one of my first larger efforts and needs to be refactored big time...



## Browser Support

Tape Loop Demo has been tested and works in the following browsers:

* Chrome (desktop)
* Firefox (desktop)

Currently only designed for desktop browsers, *i.e.* no mobile support.
