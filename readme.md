# Tape Loop Demo

A web-based app to do horrible things to pixelated cassette tapes, all in the name of ambient music.



## Built With

* [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) - 2D graphics library
* [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) - Interactive sound library
* [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) - Secondary sound library
* [fontfaceobserver](https://github.com/bramstein/fontfaceobserver) - Webfont loading



## Contributing

This is currently being built as a portfolio project, but any help would be appreciated. Particularly looking to expand the tape catalogue.
